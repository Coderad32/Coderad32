# Welcome

Thanks for checking out the project. This workspace collects several small projects and research efforts related to farming technology, secure protocols, and EV infrastructure.


## Mars Preserve Co-Op

Mars Preserve is a smaller co-op focused on farming and developing software tools for agriculture and farm management. The project explores automation, data-driven crop planning, and tools to support cooperative farms.

Repository: https://github.com/Coderad32/Perserve

## XTTPS / XSSL ( Custom Protocol )

XTTPS and XSSL are custom protocol and certificate-validation projects. They explore alternatives for secure communication and certificate handling, research into protocol design, and experimental implementations intended for testing and learning.

Repository: https://github.com/Coderad32/XTTPS

## Solar Pads ( SPEV Technology )

Solar Pads are solar charging units for electric vehicles (EVs), turning them into SPEVs (Solar-Powered Electric Vehicles). The project covers hardware integration, charging control logic, and software for monitoring and scheduling charging sessions.

Repository: https://github.com/Coderad32/SolarPads

## Sigil Key Mapper ( Crystal Technology )

Special Tokens Key Map Legend -- A matrix cube
of token sigils with meaning beyond what the computer 
knows about.

Repository: https://github.com/Coderad32/SigilKeyMap


## The Open System ( Shell Menu )

A menu created in shell code to demonstrate a menu options.

Repository: https://github.com/Coderad32/TheOpenSystem

## Slots ( Access To Mobile Garden Options )

Shipping containers are essential for transporting goods and donations across long distances, especially for humanitarian aid and disaster relief. Proper storage and management of these containers ensure that donations reach their destinations efficiently and safely.

Repository: https://github.com/Coderad32/Slots



## Blockchain Game Studios (BGS)

The one and only game studio build with blockchain in mind.

### Blockchain Technology Stack

Smart Contracts: Solidity contracts for asset tokenization, provenance, and secure transactions

Integration: MetaMask, Hardhat, and Ethers.js for seamless DApp interaction

### Features: 

-Tokenized crop assets and logistics tracking 
-Decentralized XTTPS XSSL certificate validation
-AEAD cryptographic primitives (ChaCha20‑Poly1305, AES‑GCM) for secure communication.

Containerization: Dockerized blockchain nodes for reproducible environments and easy deployment.
