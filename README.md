## Blockchain Foundation Project Overview

## Introduction

Welcome to the Blockchain Foundation project on GitHub. We're grateful for our sponsors and contributors who drive our development efforts.

At Blockchain Foundation, we see blockchain as more than a decentralized ledger or p2p network. 

We define it as a network of interconnected computers running a shared program, forming a collection of innovative ideas that propel development towards specific goals long into the future make our lives better for all.

## Key Components
