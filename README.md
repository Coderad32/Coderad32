## Introduction

Foundation Blockchain is the simple concept of connecting computers together 
using a program inside the project. What is blockchain is a p2p network chain
of computers connected however a regular definition is that a blockchain is a ledger
but I dont stop there what blockchain really is are a bunch of ideas woven together
to form a concept and to encourage development towards a specific topic.

- peer 2 peer (p2p) socket.hole -> socket.hole
- pair-socket() -> parameter_
- network service handler
- protocol.service.setup.api
- support.connect.system -> system_connect()

## Summary

Each person in the Founcation will have a review
just something normal to gain a better understanding
about your job and what you could do about it.

## Tokenize

Tokenization is a process about creating value inside a unit
for each unit has a value but some have more value than others.

Easy concept to understand and there are more answers than questions
So basically you would understand the concept and know more about it than
having to question it for example reading a scematic you would see 
or a video that would show you about how to do a specific task.
