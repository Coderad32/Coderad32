## Introduction
### Welcome
"Thank you for visiting our project workspace on GitHub, made possible by our sponsors and the dedicated individuals who contribute to our development efforts.

At Foundation Blockchain, we define blockchain as a simple concept: connecting computers together using a program. While a common definition describes blockchain as a decentralized ledger, we take it a step further. In our view, blockchain is a collection of interconnected ideas that form a concept, driving innovation and development towards a specific goal."

```perl

- peer 2 peer (p2p) socket.hole -> socket.hole
- pair-socket() -> parameter_

- network service handler ( Displays Protocol Interface )

- protocol.service.setup.api
- support.connect.system -> system_connect()

```
Blockchain tokens are digital assets that are built on top of a blockchain network. They are often used to represent a specific value, utility, or ownership in a particular project or ecosystem. Tokens can be thought of as a digital representation of a physical asset, such as a stock or a commodity, but they exist only in the digital realm.

There are several types of blockchain tokens, including:

Utility tokens: These tokens are used to access a specific service or product within a blockchain-based platform. For example, a token might be used to pay for transactions on a decentralized exchange.
Security tokens: These tokens represent ownership in a company or project and can be used to raise capital through initial coin offerings (ICOs).
Payment tokens: These tokens are used as a form of digital currency, similar to Bitcoin or Ethereum.
NFT tokens (Non-Fungible Tokens): These tokens represent unique digital assets, such as art, collectibles, or virtual real estate.
Governance tokens: These tokens are used to vote on decisions within a blockchain-based project or community.
Blockchain tokens can be created using various blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or Polkadot. They can be traded on cryptocurrency exchanges, used to access specific services, or held as an investment.

Some key characteristics of blockchain tokens include:

Decentralized: Tokens are stored on a blockchain network, which means that they are not controlled by a single entity.
Digital: Tokens exist only in the digital realm and are not physical assets.
Programmable: Tokens can be programmed to have specific rules and regulations, such as smart contracts.
Transferable: Tokens can be transferred from one person to another, similar to physical currency.

## Tokenize

"Tokenization is a process about creating value inside a unit
for each unit has a value but some have more value than others."

"Easy concept to understand and there are more answers than questions
So basically you would understand the concept and know more about it than
having to question it for example reading a scematic you would see 
or a video that would show you about how to do a specific task."


## Options

"This section talks about options and what every user can do with their support role
Each option is for the foundation and every member can take a stake or a part
To create a workspace and development team at the foundation."

```perl

> $ open source founation software support fork

- 1. A fund a way forward        # Push forwards
- 2. B take part in giving back  # Take A Gamble
- 3. C result about development  # Promote Success

```

```perl

##  Main Menu

1. Payroll              -> # DATA( payroll )
2. Rate of return       -> # ...12x
3. Investing            -> # ...1000xsavings
4. Banking CDs          -> # ...5000xCDs
5. Debts of company     -> # ...0

```

## Growth / Teamwork 1.0

"We plan to scale operations in the foundation by understanding better what we can do for you as 
an orginization shaping the project around the user and creating a sustatainable formation to take place.
While this takes shape under the hood or behind the scenes while under development."

```perl
## Outlook

<HR> careers/jobs -> posted.package

# BEGIN:
# import os;
# import warnings;
# return 1;
# EOFTL file transfer line;

```
### Scalability Growth 2.0

"Over the course of a few months of work we plan to grow operations 
inside this repository making a pile of DATA."

## Summary

"Each person in the Founcation will have a review
just something normal to gain a better understanding
about your job and what you could do about it."

"Each person has a simple job to perform and that is to generate
work."
