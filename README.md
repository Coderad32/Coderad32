## Moving Onwards From Coding

Today I change what I am doing.
Learning to code is still on my mind.
Using AI tools to achive this knowledge.

Remember what I need to rememeber, and what I dont need too.
Its easy to find the information and make a sample about it
as a reference to the DATA.

## Moving Forwards In Life

Fear is nothing to let your life be determined by.
So with that being said what is hindering me at the moment ?

- Employment( next job role )
- Wealth generation( more funds )
- Relationships( networking... )

Employment figures would be better than nothing
but fortuently you can start from experience 
and the proof of work/concept of proof.

Wealth generation would be about storing wealth
and additional wealth generation keeping value
over time and adding value to a compounding interest.

- Relationships Networking ... Continued Support For Networking Relationships(inter+node)


### work-balance-life

I am a self taught developer so if there is something I dont know
or need to learn I will do so if need be cutting out the waste
not being fake and not being mean to others.

Fear is a driving force when you dont have a job/employment
I wanted to start a company that sponsors people to be their 
very best changing the world around me fear is nothing
inspiration manifest the power of the mind. 

Benefitting others overall.
