## About Me

I am currently immersed in open-source projects, continually honing my tech coding skills. My passion lies in collaborating on open-source initiatives where I can make meaningful contributions and earn a sustainable living.

Feel free to reach out. I welcome comments and feedback! Outside of work, I am an avid outdoor enthusiast, enjoying activities such as camping, hiking, and trail running. I also cherish spending quality time with loved ones. I am optimistic about a future filled with opportunities and freedom in my career and job.
