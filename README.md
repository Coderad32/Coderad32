## Authorship and Ownership
### Last Update  Mon Nov 11 01:30:18 MST 2024

I would like to dedicate these works to the people who make it possible. Your contributions, feedback, and encouragement have been invaluable in shaping this project. Time goes on without sponsorship or donations I find it hard to survive in life
so I must move onwards.

Also to note: I work alone but would love to work with other people so I could have some feedback suggestions or general comments.

## Welcome and Acknowledgments

I would like to extend my gratitude to my sponsors and career manager for their continued support. Without their help, this project would not be possible. - Legacy

## Moving Onwards From Coding

Today I change what I am doing.
Learning to code is still on my mind.
Using AI tools to achive this knowledge.

Remember what I need to rememeber, and what I dont need too.
Its easy to find the information and make a sample about it
as a reference to the DATA.

## Moving Forwards In Life

Fear is nothing to let your life be determined by.
So with that being said what is hindering me at the moment ?

- Employment( job role )
- Wealth generation( funds )
- Relationships( networking )

## OFFLINE DATA

In the real world I sit behind a stationary that I built myself
it features:

-Two boards 
-Two different types of desk
-Three differnet lights
-A dual monitor (television set)
-PS/1 console with games
-A secondary keyboard 
-4k Camera ( sort of )

<br>

- Books( shell bash bible )
- Think Perl(raku perl 6ish)
- The blockchain developer
- mastering machine learning 
- Thermos H20(water)
- -=/+_ Character EQ
- +-/+_  Additional Underscored



## META CONFIGS

+ Universal ( DATABASE )   -> established technology

  Fresh Constant DATA from sensors
  
+ Equational ( THEORY )    -> proof of time
  
+ Computation ( PRACTICE ) -> proof of work

### work-balance-life

I am a self taught developer so if there is something I dont know
or need to learn I will do so if need be cutting out the waste
not being fake and not being mean to others.

Fear is a driving force when you dont have a job/employment
I wanted to start a company that sponsors people to be their 
very best changing the world around me fear is nothing
inspiration manifest the power of the mind. 

Benefitting others overall.
