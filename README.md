## Welcome

This script talks about control structures mainly found within my own lanaguage and it really
has nothing to do with perl but rather perl provides a space for my langauge to run inside
the enviornment window.

```perl

$!=status

  for: $! "status" inside for COMMAND sub auth_command_console {...};
while: $! "status" while ACTIVE auth sub console_command_auth { [...] };
   do: $! shift > do $@declare_package else wait 1000ms return my $item = 32

$@=declare
 
  for: $@ "declare" statement DIR[ R.F.P. ]
while: $@ "delcare" sub command_console {...};
  do: $@ "delcare" @CODE{set|value|command > service|console>command}

$#=comment
      
      $# MAIN MENU CTRL
    $# READ THE MANUAL
    $# READ THE CODE BLOCKS
    $# READ WHAT YOU CAN WHILE YOU CAN
      $# continue read more [ ... ]

$$=verify

for $$caller->syscaller.$$.control.verify console connected.

$%=hash

for while $% "hash" DATA: read(DATA) else pause return 0;

$^=lookup

for lookup function parameter open
lookup( search with eyes. )

$&=runtime

for $& sub console_command { [...] ongoing. }
IF NOT VALID $& command_console { [ ... online. ]}

$*=permission

$* for inside( program > auth $* () )
IF $* NOT VALID AUTH LOGIN push > open command|code

$(=open
  EXAMPLE: $( must have $) attached unless other wise noted.

$)=close

 EXAMPLE: $) = close the scalar with a close paren
   for if $( one must $) the statment.
