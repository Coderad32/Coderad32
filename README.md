A personal project I work on in my free time, where I can learn and grow
new methods && skills, crafting new software to meet the requirements.

With That being said: Id like to spend more time working on these 
projects I have created as an artist or developer, developing crafting software.

Builder of Practical & Futuristic Ideas

I’m a self‑taught developer based in the mountains of Colorado, where I work remotely and build software that blends creativity, practicality, and curiosity. 

Exploring new tools, designing clean interfaces, and developing systems that solve real problems — from blockchain experiments to polished resume websites. Self‑driven learner who enjoys the independence of remote work and the quiet of the mountains. 

To build things — whether it’s a polished website, a futuristic concept, or a clever automation script. Every project is a chance to learn something new.

So ... without any further-ado [Mars Preserve Co-Op]{Source Code} at github.com/marspreserve > Research | Educational > Repository.

Thanks for checking out the project. This workspace collects several small projects and research efforts related to farming technology, secure protocols, and EV infrastructure power generation and wealth building.

## Mars Preserve Co-Op

Mars Preserve is a smaller co-op focused on farming and developing software tools for agriculture and farm management. The project explores automation, data-driven crop planning, and tools to support cooperative farms.
