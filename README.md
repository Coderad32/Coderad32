## Security Information

- I don't use email.
- I don't read PDFs.
- I don't write software anymore.

I plan on scrubbing some data about myself off the internet; Removing old projects that no longer interest me, and gaining credit for what I do here on GitHub as a digital entrepreneur.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills

I have learned a little about a lot of different languages, including:
- **JavaScript** for functionality
- **CSS** for stylesheets
- **HTML** for frameworks
- **Perl** for symbolic logic
- **Solidity** for smart contracts

I am learning every day, and if there is a problem or question I can't solve at the moment, I will find the answer and stay positive in my job role.

## üå≥ Future Growth üå≥

I plan on building projects for my homestead that I hope to create in my life and times. I aim to build auto-grow boxes, automating the growth process for farmers to make it more accessible and efficient out of the box.

I also would like to do research and start a foundation. This foundation would build the auto-grow boxes for sale, creating a patent for the project's innovation.

Speaking of innovation, I would also like to create a water-powered generator to charge batteries for my lights and other power requirements.

- **Digital Identity**: I protect my online 
brand and persona and take my security 
online seriously and persue the rules.
