## Authorship and Ownership
### Last Update  Mon Nov 11 01:30:18 MST 2024

I would like to dedicate these works to the people who make it possible. Your contributions, feedback, and encouragement have been invaluable in shaping this project. Time goes on without sponsorship or donations I find it hard to surivive in life
so I must move onwards.

Also to note: I work alone but would love to work with other people so I could have some feedback suggestions or general comments.

## Welcome and Acknowledgments

I would like to extend my gratitude to my sponsors and career manager for their continued support. Without their help, this project would not be possible. - Legacy

## Moving Onwards From Coding

Today I change what I am doing.
Learning to code is still on my mind.
Using AI tools to achive this knowledge.

Remember what I need to rememeber, and what I dont need too.

## Moving Forwards In Life

Fear is nothing to let your life be determined by.
So with that being said what is hindering me at the moment ?

- Employment
- Wealth generation
- Relationships

### work-balance-life

I am a self taught developer so if there is something I dont know
or need to learn I will do so if need be cutting out the waste
not being fake and not being mean to others.

Fear is a driving force when you dont have a job/employment
I wanted to start a company that sponsors people to be their 
very best changing the world around me fear is nothing
inspiration manifest the power of the mind. 

Benefitting others overall.
